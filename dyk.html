                                    <p>Early in pre-production, Dr. Kip Thorne laid down two guidelines to strictly follow: 
                                        nothing would violate established physical laws, and that all the wild speculations 
                                        would spring from science, and not from the creative mind of a screenwriter.</p>

                                    <p>To create the wormhole and black hole, Dr. Kip Thorne collaborated with Visual Effects Supervisor Paul J. Franklin and his team at Double Negative.
                                        Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations 
                                        to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to one hundred hours to render, and ultimately the whole
                                        CGI program reached to eight hundred terabytes of data. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational 
                                        lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and led to him writing two scientific papers, one for the astrophysics community, and one for the 
                                        computer graphics community.</p>

                                    <p>The majority of shots of the robot TARS were not computer generated. Rather, TARS was a practical puppet controlled and voiced on-set by Bill Irwin, 
                                        who was then digitally erased from the movie. Irwin also puppeteered the robot CASE, but in that instance, had his voice dubbed over by Josh Stewart.</p>
